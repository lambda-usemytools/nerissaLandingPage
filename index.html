                        <p class="when-you-create-an-a">When you create an account with Use My Tools you can easily add all of the tools that you have in your garage.  When you add those tools you can choose if you want the tool to be available to your garage only, your network , or out for rental.

A tool that is added for your network can be loaned out to anyone you have chosent to add to your network.  You might not get paid for loaning out tools to your network, but hopefully they will return the favor.
