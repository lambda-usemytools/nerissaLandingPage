What problem does your app solve?
“I have a lot of tools and need a way to keep them organized” 
“I’m often loaning out tools to my neighbors/friends/family I need a way to keep track of who has my tools and how long they have had them.”
“I have a lot of tools and I would like to make some extra money by renting those tools out.”
“I need a way to find tools that I can borrow or rent from others in my area, 
Makes clear the availability of tools for lending and tracks who borrowed them, and if they’ve been returned.

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

Users can create an account, and post the tools they have available, along with pictures of the tools. Utilizing user location, the app can show which tools are available within a certain radius, as well as searching within friend lists for tools. The users will update when the tool is borrowed, and when it is returned. Both parties must agree that these have occurred.

 Mission statement

No one of modest income can afford all the tools he or she may need for the multitude of tasks life throws at them, and few tools see much use before they rust, or become lost or discarded. With Use My Tools, we will help users work to reduce the redundancy of buying ten hammers, when 2 would suffice, of purchasing a power drill, only to use it once every few years. Users will save money, create greater bonds in their communities, and maybe even make a few friends along the way; friend who can explain the proper use of the tools.

Use My Tools is a platform for tool owners to organize and share tools.  It is also a platform for tool seekers to find tools to use.  Finally, it is a platform where these two can meet. 
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

MVP: Users can log in and create a profile. They can then set up items they have available - anything from a shovel to power washers to tile saws. Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data. A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have available and request to borrow.

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

Review system, map radius, friend system. 
We would like to explore the idea of adding a community function to the app in the future.  A user could create a community DIY project (ex.  users could log in to network and build community.  Users could offer to loan tools or volunteer to work on that project.  This would create a community where individuals can come together to work on projects that will better their community.

Additionally, we would like to add the feature of a user being able to upload projects that they are working on or have completed.  The user would be able to upload pictures of their projects and also a list of all the tools that they are using or have used for the project to create a kind of project recipe.

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

Maybe?  Google Map Integration

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

I’m not entirely sure. They say that the free version of gsap is pretty commercial friendly, yet they have a business license too. 

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

No, I haven’t.

Target Audience


- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

Our Target audience is tool owners, aged 25- 65.  Our target audience has at least a basic technological understanding.  We anticipate that our audience is largely male but is actively engaged in ensuring an inclusive platform.  Our target audience lives in moderately to heavily populated areas. 


- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

Potential users really enjoy the simplicity and straight forward layout of the process of Use My Tools. The prototype was tested with 3 potential users ranging in age from 25-45.  The users thought that this app was something they could use to organize tools and also borrow or rent tools as necessary.  


- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Yes, the prototype has been tested with the target audience with usertesting.com.  They were asked to describe what problem this app is designed to solve, if they see this as a problem and if the problem is addressed or solved by the Use My Tools app. Each of the users that tested the prototype was easily able to identify the problem that the app was attempting to solve and could see themselves using this app in their daily lives. 

Research


- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

The Use My Tools app has been tested in a variety of manners.  Through competitive analysis and user interviews, we were able to identify the core message, function, target audience and proto-persona for our project.  We have done 5-second tests and first clicks to help identify our primary color and hero image for the marketing page.  Through brainstorming exercises, card sorting and site mapping we were able to develop core user flows.  Finally, after developing a fairly built out proto-type the app was tested through usertesting.com to test the function of the app, the aesthetic of the app, and the likelihood that this app solves the problem.  
Prototype Key Feature(s)


- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
